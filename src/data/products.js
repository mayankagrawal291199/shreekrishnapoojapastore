I'll definitely purchase it. Kindly maintain the good quality, since a lot of duplicate products are available in the market.",

This is the best dhoop cone I ever used. Also I like the bamboo less agarbatti. I have used it and it's smell amazing and the burning time also was good.",

Daily I require 4 to 5 Nos. and more on auspicious days. The quality of incense was too good. Highly Recommended.",

      "I am very picky about my incense (and fragrances in general) and this is amazing!!! I've had a few great experiences with pujapa products, but I had never tried this particular scent before. I am IN LOVE with this fragrance. It's not as heavy or musky as a 'red rose' fragrance, but it has some absolutely beautiful notes.",
